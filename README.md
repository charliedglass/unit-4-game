# Crystals Collector
Welcome to my game, <b>Crystals Collector</b>!

The game starts with a random number appearing, your score of 0, and 4 pictures of different crystals.  The random number is one between 19 and 120, and each crystal contains a random number between 1 and 12.  When a crystal is clicked, its number gets added on to your score.  If your score equals the random number above it, you win, and your win total gets updated.  If it is greater, you lose, and your losses increase.  After the game ends, a new random number is generated, and four new random numbers are generated for each crystal, allowing you to play a brand new game.

Thanks for playing, and good luck!
